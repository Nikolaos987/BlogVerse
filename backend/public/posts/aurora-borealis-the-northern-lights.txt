<h1>Aurora Borealis: The Northern Lights</h1>
<p>The Aurora Borealis, also known as the Northern Lights, is one of nature's most mesmerizing phenomena. It occurs when particles from the sun collide with the Earth's atmosphere, producing vibrant displays of light that dance across the sky. The colors range from bright greens to deep purples, creating a stunning spectacle in the polar regions.</p>

<h2>The Science Behind the Magic</h2>
<p>While the lights may seem magical, there is fascinating science at play. Charged particles from solar winds are drawn toward the Earth's poles by its magnetic field. As these particles enter the atmosphere, they collide with gases like oxygen and nitrogen, causing the light displays we know as auroras.</p>
